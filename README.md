# GA4GH NCBI API

Genomic data is often very large and requires metadata in order to be used as
part of an inquiry. To make the process of discovering and analyzing genomic
data less of a challenge, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)
has designed an "easy-to-implement" HTTP API that lets you get at just the data
relevant to a specific inquiry.

The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) curates a great deal
of invaluable genomic data. By making these data available using GA4GH methods
the NCBI data becomes discoverable using GA4GH HTTP Clients.
